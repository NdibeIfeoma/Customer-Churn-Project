## PROJECT OVERVIEW
ConnectTel Telecom Company a leading company in Telecommunications faces the pressing need to address customer churn, which poses a significant threat to its business sustainability and growth.
As a Data Scientist, leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning models on available customer data accurately forecasts customer churn and implements targeted retention initiatives.


## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
ConnectTel aims to develop a robust customer churn prediction system to create initiative:
i.	Reduce customer attrition.
ii.	Enhance customer loyalty, and maintain a competitive edge in the highly dynamic and competitive telecommunications industry.


## DATA SOURCE
-	Data was provided by 10Alytics.
  

## DATA CLEANING & PREPARATION
-	The data had no missing data.
  

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
 -  I carried out Exploratory Data Analysis using Python and a series of data visualizations on the data.
a) I  visualized the relationships between the label and some key features.
b) I explored the correlations among the variables.
c) I also conducted a univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis as much as feasible.


## MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE

I performed a feature engineering  - Encoding categorical variables
Machine Learning Model selection, training, testing of 80: 20- using 4 supervised learning model
i.	Linear Regression
ii.	Random Forest Classifier
iii.	Gradient Boosting Classifier
iv.	X-Boost Classifier


## FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS:

 ## INSIGHTS/ FINDINGS:
-	This was a weak correlation among all the variables.
-	About 70% of the customers do not receive technical support. This can lead to a high churn rate as seen.
-	Customers prefer electronic modes of payment and they are the highest churners.
-	Short-term contracts are not favourable to Connectel Ltd.
-	Customers within their first 12 months have a high rate of churning.
-	Customers with fibre optic internet service have a high rate of churning.
-	26.6% of the customers had reasons to cancel their subscription to Connectel services while 73.4% did not cancel   service.
-	49% of Connectel customers do not get tech support.
-	90.3% of the customers have phone service.


RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Improve its Technical Support to render real-time processing of complaints
2. Work on Pricing rates that attract and retain customers
